Lestim
=====================

Hi, this is **Lestim**, an elegant and easy to use environment. 
Lestim was developed in Python and GTK, so it is very easy to hack and customize... 
Feel comfortable, **use Lestim!**

> **NOTE:**
> 
> - Lestim is still under development.
> - If you want to contribute to the project, send me a pull request :-)
